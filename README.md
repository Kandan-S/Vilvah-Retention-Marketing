## ðŸ”„ Process Followed to Create the Worksheet  

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Raw data was exported from CRM/website tools (could later integrate HubSpot & Google Analytics).  
   - Files included **customer IDs, purchase dates, revenue, and demographics**.  

2. **Data Cleaning in Excel**  
   - Removed duplicates using:  
     ```excel
     =UNIQUE(A2:A1000)
     ```  
   - Filled missing values using conditional logic:  
     ```excel
     =IF(ISBLANK(B2),"Unknown",B2)
     ```  

3. **Cohort Grouping for Retention**  
   - Created a purchase month column using:  
     ```excel
     =TEXT(Purchase_Date,"MMM-YYYY")
     ```  
   - Grouped customers by first purchase month to track repeat activity.  

4. **Retention Rate Calculation**  
   - Counted customers retained in subsequent months using:  
     ```excel
     =COUNTIFS(Customer_ID_Range,Customer_ID,Month_Range,Target_Month)
     ```  
   - Retention % formula:  
     ```excel
     = (Retained_Customers / Original_Customers) * 100
     ```  

5. **Target vs Actual KPIs**  
   - Pulled retention targets from `vilvah_retention_targets.csv`  
   - Compared with actual retention using:  
     ```excel
     =Actual_Retention - Target_Retention
     ```  

6. **Dashboard in Power BI**  
   - Loaded cleaned Excel sheet into Power BI.  
   - Created **line charts** for retention trend, **cards** for KPIs, and **table visuals** for customer cohorts.  
   - Applied Vilvah branding (logo, theme colors).
